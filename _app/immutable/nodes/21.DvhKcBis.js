			WPLACE Terms of Service. By playing WPLACE, you agree to comply with both documents.</p> <ul><li><strong>Removal of Content:</strong> WPLACE reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to remove,
				alter, or delete any artwork or content that violates these Rules or the Terms of Service. This
				may also apply in cases where content, even if not explicitly listed as a violation, undermines
				the integrity, safety, or overall experience of the community.</li> <li><strong>Appeals:</strong> Players who believe their account has been wrongfully banned may
				submit an appeal through this <a href="https://forms.gle/tpDWwewuK5i9C52s8">link</a>.
				Appeals will only be reviewed if the player can provide sufficient proof of legitimate
				account ownership. WPLACE retains sole authority in the final decision of all appeals.</li> <li><strong>Player Responsibility:</strong> Each player is responsible for their account and all
				content created with it. (e.g., by creating new accounts to bypass a ban may result in additional
				penalties, including permanent removal from the platform)</li></ul> <p class="font-medium">By participating in WPLACE, you acknowledge and accept that enforcement actions including
			suspensions, removal of artworks, and permanent bans are necessary to maintain a safe, fair,
			and enjoyable environment for the community.</p> <p class="font-medium">While the rules below provide guidance, WPLACE reserves the right to remove any content or
			take action against any account at its sole discretion, even in situations not explicitly
			covered here. This ensures we can protect the safety, fairness, and integrity of the game and
			its community.</p> <p><strong>Disclaimer: WPLACE is not responsible for any damages, losses, or modifications to drawings
				created within the platform.</strong></p></section> <section><h2 class="text-center">Code of Conduct</h2> <p>Rules are an essential part of the game, and without them, the experience would quickly become
			chaotic and unfair. They exist to guide how the game works and to ensure that every player has
			the chance to enjoy it fully.</p> <p>To give you a clearer idea, here’s why rules are so important:</p> <ul><li>They set clear boundaries on what can and cannot be done.</li> <li>They prevent actions that would frustrate or harm most players.</li> <li>They keep the environment safe and organized, allowing for both competition and
				collaboration, depending on the context.</li> <li>They protect against unfair advantages and maintain balance.</li> <li>When designed and followed correctly, they make room for strategies and even create unique
				in-game cultures.</li></ul> <p><strong>In short, rules are what allow us to keep the fun structured, fair, and welcoming for
				everyone who takes part in this community.</strong></p> <!> <section><h3>1.1 Art Integrity and Griefing</h3> <p><i>Penalty: Temporary Suspension (Timeout)</i></p> <p>Griefing is the deliberate act of vandalizing existing artworks in the game, typically by
				covering them with random pixels, scribbles, solid color, or repetitive patterns. Unlike
				genuine creativity, the intent behind griefing is not to add or improve, but to damage,
				distort, or erase the original artwork. This behavior is strictly against the rules.</p> <p><strong>Examples of violations (rule-breaking):</strong></p> <ul><li>Scribbling or placing random pixels over existing artworks.</li> <li>Covering or erasing existing artworks with solid colors or repetitive patterns.</li></ul> <p><strong>Examples that are not violations (not rule-breaking):</strong></p> <ul><li>Changing details without compromising the integrity of the artwork (e.g., changing the
					color of a character’s shirt).</li> <li>Complementing existing artworks without breaking the rules (e.g., adding a funny comment)</li> <li>Painting new artwork on top of a previous one.</li> <li>Painting the background of existing artworks with a single color or with repetitive
					patterns.</li> <li>Erasing drawings that violate the rules.</li> <li>Erasing self-promotional or commercial content on the map.</li></ul> <p><strong>WPLACE is a dynamic game: artworks can appear, grow, and even be replaced. What is not
					allowed is making a mess just to disturb other players, without any clear artistic
					intention.</strong></p></section> <section><h3>1.2 Inappropriate Content</h3> <p>It is forbidden to publish or display in the game any type of explicit or questionable +18
				content, hate speech, or other forms of material that compromise safety, integrity, the
				environment, or that make auditing difficult.</p> <section><h4>1.2.1 +18 Content</h4> <p><i>Penalty: Temporary Suspension (Timeout) or Permanent Ban</i></p> <p>Minor violations in this category, such as light or jokingly suggestive drawings, may
					result in a temporary suspension (timeout) as a warning. However, more explicit or severe
					content that clearly breaks the rules will lead to a permanent ban. The decision on the
					appropriate penalty will be made at the sole discretion of the moderation team, but any
					rule-breaking described below will lead to a permanent ban.</p> <p><strong>Examples of violations (rule-breaking - Permanent Ban):</strong></p> <ul><li>Explicit depictions of genitals (e.g., vulvas, penises, penile sheaths, testicles,
						perineum, nipples, outlines of sexual organs, genital openings, cloacas, anus).</li> <li>Sexual or suggestive acts: masturbation, use of sex toys, tongue kissing, groping,
						grinding, straddling, or lap dancing.</li> <li>Display of genital fluids, erotic clothing, or highly suggestive poses.</li> <li>Explicit fetish content (e.g., BDSM, vore, scat, urophilia, zoophilia, necrophilia,
						inflation, guro, infantilization, asphyxiation, castration, bondage, adults wearing
						diapers).</li> <li>Realistic graphic violence or references to real situations of extreme violence.</li></ul> <p><strong>Examples that are not violations (not rule-breaking):</strong></p> <ul><li>Non-suggestive art of characters in underwear or swimwear, except when depicting
						minor-like characters.</li> <li>Representations of light or stylized/cartoonish blood.</li> <li>Common short clothing (e.g., shorts, miniskirt, top, bikini).</li> <li>Characters in normal contexts such as the beach, pool, or gym.</li> <li>Light gestures of affection (e.g., hug, kiss on the cheek, peck).</li></ul></section> <section><h4>1.2.2 Hate Speech</h4> <p><i>Penalty: Permanent Ban</i></p> <p>Hate speech is any form of message, symbol, or artwork created in the game with the intent
					to harass, discriminate, or incite violence against individuals or groups based on their
					personal characteristics or identity.</p> <p><strong>Examples of violations (rule-breaking):</strong></p> <ul><li>Messages, symbols, or drawings that attack individuals or groups based on race,
						ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, disability, or other
						personal characteristics.</li> <li>Representation of hate symbols (e.g., swastikas, extremist flags, logos of organizations
						linked to hate).</li> <li>Use of insults, slurs, or language that encourages discrimination, violence, hostility,
						or segregation.</li></ul> <p><strong>Examples that are not violations (not rule-breaking):</strong></p> <ul><li>Criticism, satire, or parody that is not directed at vulnerable groups and does not
						reinforce harmful stereotypes.</li> <li>Neutral references to historical or cultural symbols when used in an educational,
						informative, or artistic context, without offensive intent.</li> <li>General artistic expressions that do not promote hostility or harm to specific
						communities.</li></ul> <strong>The line between satire and offense can be subjective. In such cases, the final decision
					rests with the moderation team.</strong></section> <section><h4>1.2.3 Links and QR Codes</h4> <p><i>Penalty: Temporary Suspension (Timeout) or Permanent Ban</i></p> <p>It is forbidden to share or display in the game any type of external link or QR code that
					can lead to phishing, malware, tracking/affiliate, abuse, or inappropriate content.</p> <p><strong>Examples of violations (rule-breaking):</strong></p> <ul><li>Inserting any link/QR code that might lead to phishing, malware, tracking/affiliate,
						abuse, or inappropriate content.</li> <li>Using misleading titles or shortened URLs to hide where the link goes.</li></ul> <p><strong>Examples that are not violations (not rule-breaking):</strong></p> <ul><li>Inserting links/QR codes to trusted websites (e.g., YouTube, Figma, Discord,…)</li></ul></section> <section><h4>1.2.4 Highly Suggestive/Criminal Content</h4> <p><i>Penalty: Permanent Ban</i></p> <p>It is forbidden to display any content that represents or suggests criminal sexual
					practices, exploitation, or situations that compromise people’s physical or psychological
					safety.</p> <p><strong>Examples of violations (rule-breaking):</strong></p> <ul><li>Representations of pedophilia, child sexual exploitation, or child sexual abuse.</li> <li>Content that suggests or depicts necrophilia.</li> <li>Representations of human trafficking, sexual exploitation, or the promotion of such
						crimes.</li> <li>Any drawing or message that directly or indirectly refers to sexual exploitation or
						related criminal practices.</li></ul> <p><strong>Examples that are not violations (not rule-breaking):</strong></p> <ul><li>There are no exceptions: any content that falls into these categories is strictly
						prohibited and will be removed immediately.</li></ul> <p><strong>Content of this nature may result not only in immediate banishment but also in being
						reported to the appropriate authorities.</strong></p></section></section> <section><h3>1.3 Multiple Accounts</h3> <p><i>Penalty: Permanent Ban</i></p> <p>Each player must have only one active account. Using multiple accounts unbalances the pixel
				system, creates unfair advantages, and harms the overall experience for other players.</p> <p><strong>Examples of violations (rule-breaking):</strong></p> <ul><li>Creating additional accounts to accumulate more pixels.</li> <li>Using secondary accounts to reinforce or protect your own artworks.</li> <li>Creating fake accounts to sabotage or attack other players’ artworks.</li></ul> <p><strong>Examples that are not violations (not rule-breaking):</strong></p> <ul><li>Maintaining only one active account per person, even if accessed on different devices (PC,
					mobile, tablet).</li> <li>Playing in public or shared locations (cybercafés, schools, workplaces, etc.), as long as
					each player uses only their own account.</li> <li>Recovering a legitimate older account (with your own usage history), provided the previous
					one is no longer active at the same time.</li></ul></section> <section><h3>1.4 Automation</h3> <p><i>Penalty: Permanent Ban</i></p> <p>The use of any automation tools, scripts, bots, or programs that simulate user input or
				replace manual interaction for painting is strictly prohibited.</p> <p><strong>Examples of violations (rule-breaking):</strong></p> <ul><li>Using bots or scripts that automatically paint pixels.</li></ul> <p><strong>Examples that are not violations (not rule-breaking):</strong></p> <ul><li>Using external image-editing tools only for planning purposes (e.g., designing in
					Photoshop, GIMP etc.), as long as the reproduction in the game is done manually.</li> <li>Using tools that do not automate user inputs (e.g., map overlays, visual aids).</li></ul></section> <section><h3>1.5 Doxxing</h3> <p><i>Penalty: Permanent Ban</i></p> <p>It is forbidden to disclose or expose personal information of others or yourself within the
				game. Doxxing puts people’s privacy and safety at risk and will not be tolerated under any
				circumstances.</p> <p><strong>Examples of violations (rule-breaking):</strong></p> <ul><li>Publishing full names, documents, addresses, phone numbers, emails, or any other personal
					data.</li> <li>Sharing screenshots, photos, or recordings that reveal private information of other
					players.</li> <li>Inducing, pressuring, or encouraging others to expose personal information in the game.</li> <li>Using personal information to threaten, embarrass, or harm someone.</li></ul> <p><strong>Examples that are not violations (not rule-breaking):</strong></p> <ul><li>Sharing public, non-sensitive information about well-known figures (e.g., names of
					artists, characters or public personalities).</li> <li>Using nicknames, pseudonyms, or fictional names not linked to real personal data of
					others.</li></ul> <p><strong>Content of this nature may result not only in immediate banishment but also in being
					reported to the appropriate authorities.</strong></p></section> <section><h3>1.6 Political Content (Party Flags and Portraits of Politicians)</h3> <p><i>Penalty: Temporary Suspension (Timeout)</i></p> <p>Unlike other types of artworks, political content such as party flags, electoral symbols,
				and portraits of politicians can be drawn, modified, or replaced freely by any player.</p> <p>The following symbols are considered non-political and should be treated like any other
				artwork, meaning that standard rules apply to them:</p> <ul><li>National, state, and city flags</li> <li>LGBT+, trans, intersex, and non-binary pride symbols</li> <li>Indigenous peoples' symbols</li> <li>Disability pride symbols</li> <li>Identity-related and social inclusion movements</li> <li>Historical or cultural movement symbols</li></ul> <p><strong>Examples of violations (rule-breaking):</strong></p> <ul><li>Griefing non-political content.</li></ul> <p><strong>Examples that are not violations (not rule-breaking):</strong></p> <ul><li>Modifying or drawing over political symbols (e.g., political party flags, campaign logos,
					portraits of candidates or current politicians).</li></ul></section> <section><h3>1.7 Impersonation, Fraud, and Trade</h3> <p><i>Penalty: Permanent Ban</i></p> <p>It is forbidden to impersonate others, deceive players, or conduct unauthorized trade within
				the game. These practices compromise trust, safety, and community integrity.</p> <p><strong>Examples of violations (rule-breaking):</strong></p> <ul><li><strong>Impersonation:</strong> using names, avatars, or symbols to pose as other players,
					staff members, or known individuals.</li> <li><strong>Fraud:</strong> creating fake groups, invitations, or campaigns with the goal of deceiving
					players, gaining information, advantages, or unauthorized access.</li> <li><strong>Trade:</strong> selling, exchanging, or offering accounts, pixels, artworks, advantages,
					or any other game-related items in exchange for money, goods, or services.</li></ul> <p><strong>Examples that are not violations (not rule-breaking):</strong></p> <ul><li>Using creative or humorous nicknames, as long as they don’t lead others to believe you are
					someone else.</li> <li>Creating parody or satire artworks that do not pretend to be other players or staff
					members.</li> <li>Sharing artwork freely and collaboratively, without involving money or external trades.</li></ul></section> <section><h3>1.8 Evasion/System Abuse</h3> <p><i>Penalty: Permanent Ban</i></p> <p>It is forbidden to bypass restrictions, exploit or expose technical flaws, or abuse game
				systems to gain unfair advantages. This rule ensures everyone plays under fair conditions
				and within the normal functioning of the platform.</p> <p><strong>Examples of violations (rule-breaking):</strong></p> <ul><li>Attempting to circumvent account limits, bans, or other restrictions by any means.</li> <li>Exploiting bugs, programming flaws, or system errors to gain pixels, cooldown reductions,
					unauthorized access, or other advantages.</li> <li>Attempting to evade penalties (ban, account restrictions, cooldowns) by creating new
					accounts or using technical manipulation.</li></ul> <p><strong>Examples that are not violations (not rule-breaking):</strong></p> <ul><li>Reporting bugs or flaws to the team responsibly without exploiting them.</li> <li>Using features already available in the official game client.</li> <li>Playing on different devices (PC, mobile, tablet), if the one account per person rule is
					respected.</li></ul> <p><strong>Deliberate exploitation of bugs, flaws, or penalty evasion may result in immediate
					banishment. Depending on severity, it may also lead to the removal of artworks created
					with unfair advantage.</strong></p></section> <section><h3>1.9 Threats</h3> <p><i>Penalty: Permanent Ban</i></p> <p>It is forbidden to use the game to make threats against other players, groups, or anyone.
				Threats include both direct promises of physical or psychological harm and insinuations that
				create fear or intimidation.</p> <p><strong>Examples of violations (rule-breaking):</strong></p> <ul><li>Writing messages or drawing symbols indicating that someone will be attacked, stalked or
					killed.</li> <li>Threatening to harm a player (e.g., “I know where you live, I’ll find you”).</li> <li>Intimidation in the game that goes beyond artistic or humorous context, showing clear
					intent to cause fear.</li></ul> <p><strong>Examples that are not violations (not rule-breaking):</strong></p> <ul><li>Using clearly fictional or humorous phrases or symbols without real intent to intimidate.</li> <li>Representations of fictional conflicts, without references to real personal attacks.</li> <li>Artworks with themes of battles or fights that are not directed at specific players.</li></ul></section> <section><h3>1.10 Self-Harm and Suicide</h3> <p><i>Penalty: Temporary Suspension (Timeout)</i></p> <p>It is forbidden to use the game to promote, encourage, or instruct self-harm or suicide.
				WPLACE is not a place to normalize or encourage such behavior, as it may trigger players and
				put them at risk.</p> <p><strong>Examples of violations (rule-breaking):</strong></p> <ul><li>Messages or artworks encouraging others to harm themselves or commit suicide.</li> <li>Graphic or detailed representations of self-harm or suicide methods.</li> <li>Content that glorifies or treats self-destruction in a positive way.</li></ul> <p><strong>Examples that are not violations (not rule-breaking):</strong></p> <ul><li>Messages of support or awareness about mental health (e.g., “you are not alone,”
					prevention campaigns).</li> <li>Abstract or metaphorical artistic representations of suffering, if they do not encourage
					self-harm.</li> <li>References to cultural works (e.g., songs, books, movies) without explicit description or
					encouragement of suicide or self-harm.</li></ul> <p><strong>If you or someone you know is struggling with self-harm or suicidal thoughts, seek
					professional support in your region. What you are going through is not a joke, and you do
					not have to go through it alone.</strong></p></section> <section><h3>1.11 Crime Advocacy and Dangerous Instructions</h3> <p><i>Penalty: Permanent Ban</i></p> <p>It is forbidden to use the game to defend, encourage, or teach criminal or dangerous
				practices, whether in real life or with direct risk to players’ safety. This includes both
				content that glorifies crimes and instructions that explain how to commit them.</p> <p><strong>Examples of violations (rule-breaking):</strong></p> <ul><li>Drawing messages or symbols that promote crimes (e.g., advocacy of terrorism, Nazism,
					pedophilia, drug trafficking, murder, rape).</li> <li>Producing tutorials or instructions teaching how to conduct dangerous practices (e.g.,
					making weapons, explosives, poisons, illegal drugs).</li> <li>Content that encourages criminal self-preservation or practices that threaten public
					safety.</li></ul> <p><strong>Examples that are not violations (not rule-breaking):</strong></p> <ul><li>Historical or cultural representations (e.g., depicting a real war event) without the
					intent of encouraging or defending the crime portrayed.</li> <li>Works of fiction involving crimes or fictional villains, if they are not used to promote,
					teach, or legitimize such acts.</li> <li>Social or political criticism that references crimes in an informative or denunciative
					way, without advocacy.</li></ul> <p><strong>The game is not a space for discussions or instructions about crimes. In case of doubt,
					moderation may act preventively and remove the content.</strong></p></section> <section><h3>1.12 Intellectual Property</h3> <p><i>Penalty: Temporary Suspension (Timeout)</i></p> <p>It is forbidden to use the game to violate copyrights, trademarks, or other forms of
				intellectual property. This includes reproducing, distributing, or displaying protected
				content without the authorization of the legal owners, especially when there is risk of
				formal complaints (e.g., DMCA).</p> <p><strong>Examples of violations (rule-breaking):</strong></p> <ul><li>Reproducing logos, characters, artworks, or registered trademarks identically or with
					commercial intent, without permission.</li> <li>Publishing links or messages encouraging piracy, use of cracks or illegal distribution of
					media.</li></ul> <p><strong>Examples that are not violations (not rule-breaking):</strong></p> <ul><li>Parodic or satirical works of publicly recognizable content, when not intended for
					commercial use or deception.</li> <li>Representations inspired by characters, memes, or well-known works, as long as they are
					not direct copies meant to distribute paid content for free.</li> <li>Content using generic elements (e.g., geometric shapes, colors, common symbols) that are
					not protected by copyright.</li></ul> <p><strong>The player is always responsible for the content they publish. If a formal copyright
					violation complaint is filed, moderation may act immediately to remove the content.</strong></p></section> <section><h3>1.13 Commercial Content and Promotions</h3> <p><i>Penalty: Temporary Suspension (Timeout) or Permanent Ban</i></p> <p>Commercial activity within the game is not allowed unless explicitly authorized by the
				WPLACE team. This includes, but is not limited to, publishing external links for commercial
				purposes (such as online stores, sales websites, gambling, or cryptocurrency platforms), as
				well as sharing discount coupons, affiliate links, or other promotional content.
				Unauthorized content will be removed.</p> <p>However, self-promotion that is non-commercial in nature (such as signing artworks,
				community Discords, or personal channels) is allowed, provided it does not mislead players
				or function as advertising for products.</p> <p><strong>WPLACE also reserves the right to evaluate extraordinary situations and take enforcement
					action at its sole discretion, even if the specific behavior is not explicitly listed in
					these Rules. This ensures we can protect the safety, fairness, and integrity of the game
					and its community.</strong></p></section></section></div>`);
